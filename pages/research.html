                        When a coin is tossed in the air it flips and rotates based on the laws of motion. 
                        Although we have a good understanding of these laws it remains infeasible to predict 
                        if the coin will land heads or tails. Thus we treat the outcome of a coin flip as a random 
                        event. In every area of science there are complex systems which evolve in time, often even 
                        though we understand the mechanism of these systems predicting their long term behavior 
                        remains impossible. The approach taken in ergodic theory is to treat these systems as 
                        random and attempt to make probabilistic statements about their long term average behavior. 
                        To make use of the powerful tools of ergodic theory one needs to find an invariant measure. 
                        However often a system has many different invariant measures each of which describes the long 
                        term behavior of different initial conditions. Thus if someone is interested in understanding 
                        particular types of initial conditions then a suitable invariant measure must be constructed 
                        which ``sees" those initial conditions. The process of constructing these invariant measures 
                        is called thermodynamic formalism; having its roots in statistical physics thermodynamic 
                        formalism mimics the physical principle that nature minimizes the free energy. The resulting 
                        measures are known as equilibirum states.

                    <p class="card-text"> 
                        My work in this area has focused on studying equilibirum states which arise 
                        in multiplicative ergodic theory known as matrix equilibrium states. My work
                        focuses on the use of transfer operators to understand these equilibirum states.

                                            We study the ergodic properties of a class of measures on full shits for which the meaure 
                                            of a cylinder set is approximately the norm of a product of matrices. 
                                            The measure  is called a matrix Gibbs state. 
                                            In particular, we give a sufficient condition for a matrix Gibbs state to have 
                                            the weak Bernoulli property. We employ a number of techniques to understand these
                                             measures, including a novel approach based on Perron–Frobenius theory. We find 
                                             that when t is an even integer the ergodic properties of mu(t) are readily deduced 
                                             from finite-dimensional Perron–Frobenius theory. We then consider an extension 
                                             of this method to t > 0 using operators on an infinite-dimensional space. 
                                             Finally, we use a general result of Bradley to prove the main theorem.

                                            We show that typical cocycles (in the sense of Bonatti and Viana) over 
                                            irreducible subshifts of finite type obey several limit laws with 
                                            respect to the unique equilibrium states for Hölder potentials. 
                                            These include the central limit theorem and the large deviation principle. 
                                            We also establish the analytic dependence of the top Lyapunov exponent on 
                                            the underlying equilibrium state. The transfer operator and its spectral 
                                            properties play key roles in establishing these limit laws.

                            It is often the case that a random process can not be observed directly
                            and instead we may only observe some function of it. The most famous example
                            of this is information being transmitted across a noisey channel. The recipient
                            recieves not the true random process (the information being transmitted) but
                            instead some potentially modified version of it.

                            When the underlying random process is a Markov Chain the observed process
                            is known as a hidden Markov chain. In my work I study a generalization of
                            hidden Markov chains in which is original process is not Markov but still
                            has very regular conditional probabilities. While it is well known that
                            a hidden Markov chain can fail to Markov in my work I have shown that larger
                            classes of processes are closed when the obscuring function is sufficiently nice.

                                                We give a short proof that the projection of a Gibbs state for a
                                                H&oumlder continuous potential on a mixing shift of finite type under
                                                1-block fiber-wise mixing factor map has a H&oumlder continuous g
                                                function. This improves a number of previous results. The key insight
                                                in the proof is to realize the measure of a cylinder set in terms of
                                                positive operators and use cone techniques.

                                                It has been an open problem to identify classes of Gibbs measures less
                                                regular than H&oumlder continuous on the full shift which are closed
                                                under factor maps. In this article we show that in fact all of the
                                                classical uniqueness regimes (Bowen, Walters, and H&oumlder) from
                                                thermodynamic formalism are closed under factor maps between full
                                                shifts. In
                                                fact we
                                                show more generally that the classical uniqueness regimes are closed
                                                under
                                                factors between shifts of finite type provided the factor map satisfies
                                                a
                                                suitable mixing in fibers condition.
